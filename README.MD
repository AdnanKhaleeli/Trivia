<h1>  Trivia Project </h1>

<p> This project consists of a Dotet Backend and a React FrontEnd. This also utalizes Vite to serve up the React Page. Please Note </p>

<h2>  What the Project Does </h2>

<p> This projects main purpose is to provide a live Trivia Application. It's core utalizes SignalR which is a Dotnet package that provides RPCs through WebSockets. This tracks who sent a message, sents out a question, and allocates points to the appropriate team. </p>

<h2> 
Scope
</h2>
<p> Currently this Project works for 1 group with a number of teams. It can be scaled up to include more relatively easily due to EntityFramework Core which handles Database Migrations. However, I intentionally limited the scope due to time constraints I had. </p>
